   cargo test
   ```

For detailed network configuration and deployment, see the [Getting Started Guide](./guides/getting-started.md).

## 📝 Example Guidelines

When adding a new example, ensure it includes:

### Required Elements

## 🔄 Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-example-name
   ```

2. **Add your example** following the structure above

3. **Test thoroughly**

   ```bash
   cargo test
   cargo clippy
   cargo fmt
   ```

4. **Update documentation**
   - Add entry to main README.md
   - Create detailed README.md for your example
   - Update relevant guides if needed

5. **Submit PR** with:
   - Clear title describing the change
   - Description of what the example demonstrates
   - Any additional context or considerations

## ✅ Validation Steps

Before submitting, run the following checks:

### Targeted Checks

Run tests and checks for the specific files you changed:

```bash
# Test a specific example
cargo test -p <package-name>

# Lint a specific package
cargo clippy -p <package-name> -- -D warnings

# Format a specific package
cargo fmt -- --check
```

### Workspace Checks

If your changes affect shared tooling, docs, or examples:

```bash
# Run full workspace tests
cargo test --workspace

# Run full workspace linting
cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings

# Check formatting across workspace
cargo fmt -- --check
```

### Documentation Verification

- Ensure all links in documentation are valid
- Verify README.md files are accurate after any changes
- Check that guides remain consistent with code examples

## 🎨 Code Style

Follow standard Rust conventions:

```rust
// Good: Clear naming, proper documentation
/// Transfers tokens from one account to another.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `from` - Source account address
/// * `to` - Destination account address
/// * `amount` - Number of tokens to transfer
///
/// # Panics
/// Panics if the sender has insufficient balance.
pub fn transfer(env: Env, from: Address, to: Address, amount: i128) {
    from.require_auth();
    // Implementation...
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

Test individual functions in isolation:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_transfer() {
    let env = Env::default();
    let contract_id = env.register_contract(None, MyContract);
    // Test logic...
}
```

### Integration Tests

Test complete workflows:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_complete_workflow() {
    // Set up multiple contracts
    // Execute a full user journey
    // Verify end state
}
```
