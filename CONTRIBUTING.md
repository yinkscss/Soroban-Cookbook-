## 🎯 Ways to Contribute

1.  **Add New Examples**: Create well-documented smart contract examples demonstrating specific patterns.
2.  **Improve Documentation**: Fix typos, clarify guides, or add new documentation.
3.  **Bug Reports & Feature Requests**: Use [GitHub Issues] to report bugs or suggest new features.
4.  **Code Review**: Review open pull requests and provide constructive feedback.

## 🛠️ Development Environment Setup

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Rust**: Latest stable version.
- **WASM Target**: Required for compiling Soroban contracts.
- **Stellar CLI**: Used for building, testing, and deploying (Note: `stellar-cli` has replaced `soroban-cli`).

### 2. Installation Steps

```bash
# 1. Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf [https://sh.rustup.rs](https://sh.rustup.rs) | sh

# 2. Add WASM target
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# 3. Install Stellar CLI (version 22.1.0+ recommended)
cargo install --locked stellar-cli --version 22.1.0

# 4. Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/username/Soroban-Cookbook-.git]
cd Soroban-Cookbook-

# 5. Verify installation
cargo test --workspace
For more detailed setup, see the Getting Started Guide.

📝 Code Style Guidelines
To maintain a consistent and high-quality codebase, please follow these guidelines:

Naming: Follow standard Rust naming conventions.

Formatting: Always run cargo fmt before committing.

To maintain a consistent and high-quality codebase, please follow our [Style Guide](./docs/style-guide.md).

Key highlights:
- **Naming**: Follow standard [Rust naming conventions](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/naming.html) and our specific contract patterns.
- **Formatting**: Always run `cargo fmt` before committing.
- **Linting**: Ensure `cargo clippy` passes with no warnings (`-D warnings`).
- **Documentation**: Use `///` for public interface docs and `//!` for module-level explanations.
- **Testing**: Every example must include comprehensive unit tests.
- **No-std**: All contract code must be `#![no_std]`.

Comments: Use /// for documentation comments and // for internal logic explanation.

No-std: All contract code must be #![no_std].

🏗️ Project Structure
examples/: Categorized smart contract examples.

docs/: General documentation and ADRs.

guides/: Step-by-step tutorials and guides.

book/: Source for the mdBook documentation.

tests/: Integration tests for the workspace.

🔄 Pull Request Process
Branching: Create a feature branch from main.

Bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
Development: Implement your changes following the style guidelines.

Local Testing: Run the validation suite (see below).

Commit: Use descriptive commit messages.

Documentation: If adding an example, ensure it has a README.md and is added to the main README.md and SUMMARY.md if applicable.

Submit PR: Fill out the Pull Request Template.

🧪 Testing Requirements
All contributions must include tests:

- **Unit Tests**: In `src/test.rs` for individual function logic.
- **Integration Tests**: In `tests/` for multi-contract or complex interactions.
- **Mocking**: Use `env.mock_all_auths()` for testing authorization flows.
- **Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage. Run coverage locally with:
  ```bash
  cargo tarpaulin
  # Reports are written to coverage/ (XML, HTML, LCOV)
  # Open coverage/tarpaulin-report.html in a browser for a line-by-line view
  ```

Integration Tests: In tests/ for multi-contract or complex interactions.

Mocking: Use env.mock_all_auths() for testing authorization flows.

Coverage: Aim for high test coverage. You can check coverage locally using cargo tarpaulin.

📋 Example Contribution Template
When adding a new example in examples/category/name/:

Plaintext
name/
├── src/
│   ├── lib.rs       # Contract implementation
│   └── test.rs      # Unit tests
├── Cargo.toml       # Metadata and dependencies
└── README.md        # Description, how to run, and explanation
The README.md for the example should include:

What it does: Clear purpose statement.

Key Concepts: Explanation of Soroban features used.

How to Run: Commands for testing and building.

✅ Validation Steps
Before submitting your PR, ensure all these checks pass:

Bash
# 1. Format check
cargo fmt --all --check

# 2. Lint check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings

# 3. Run all tests
cargo test --workspace

# 4. Build Wasm (for contracts)
cargo build --workspace --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
