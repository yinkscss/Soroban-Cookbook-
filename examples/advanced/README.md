# Advanced Examples.

Complex smart contract patterns and architectural designs for experienced developers building production-grade systems on Soroban.

## 📂 Example Categories

### Authorization Patterns
Advanced methods for securing complex interactions.
- **[01-multi-party-auth](./01-multi-party-auth/)** - Multi-party authorization beyond simple multisig.
- **Planned:** Weighted voting, Dynamic signer lists, RBAC with time-bounds.

### Security & Time-Based Logic
Patterns for managing risk and execution windows.
- **[02-timelock](./02-timelock/)** - Delayed execution for governance and security.
- **Planned:** Circuit breakers, Emergency stops, Rate limiting.

### Optimization Patterns
Techniques for minimizing resource usage and gas costs.
- **Planned:** Gas optimization, Batch operations, Merkle proofs, Lazy evaluation.

### Complex Financial Patterns
Building blocks for advanced DeFi and financial systems.
- **Planned:** Bonding curves, Dutch auctions, Vesting schedules, Options protocols.

## 📋 Planned Examples

- **Factory Pattern** - Dynamic contract deployment.
- **Registry Pattern** - Service discovery and contract registration.
- **Diamond Pattern** - Modular contract architecture.
- **Beacon Proxy** - Minimal proxy with upgradeable implementation.
- **Merkle Proofs** - Efficient data verification for large datasets.
- **Bonding Curves** - Automated price discovery mechanisms.
- **Vesting Schedule** - Token vesting with cliffs and periods.

## 🎯 Prerequisites

Before exploring advanced examples, ensure mastery of:
- [Basic Examples](../basics/) - Core concepts.
- [Intermediate Examples](../intermediate/) - Common patterns.
- Rust advanced features (traits, generics, lifetimes).
- Smart contract security principles.

## 🧠 Advanced Concepts

### State Management
- Efficient storage layout and data structure design.
- Archive and restoration patterns for long-term storage.

### Security Patterns
- Time-delayed execution and emergency response mechanisms.
- Risk management through rate limiting and circuit breakers.

### Scalability
- Off-chain computation and Merkle-based state verification.
- Batch processing to maximize ledger throughput.

## 🔒 Security First

Advanced patterns increase the attack surface. Always:
1. **Audit Everything** - Professional security review is mandatory for production.
2. **Test Extensively** - Unit, integration, and fuzz testing are essential.
3. **Monitor Closely** - Implement real-time monitoring and incident response plans.
