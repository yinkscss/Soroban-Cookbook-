1# Multi-Party Authorization Patterns

This example demonstrates advanced authorization patterns in Soroban that require multiple parties to authorize an action.

## Patterns Demonstrated

### 1. Multi-Signature Transfer (AND Logic)
The `multi_sig_transfer` function requires authorization from **all** addresses provided in a `Vec<Address>`. This is useful for joint custody or mandatory multi-approval actions.

```rust
pub fn multi_sig_transfer(
    env: Env,
    signers: Vec<Address>,
    to: Address,
    amount: i128
) {
    for signer in signers.iter() {
        signer.require_auth();
    }
    // Action only proceeds if all signers authorized
}
```

### 2. Threshold Authorization (M-of-N)
The `proposal_approval` function demonstrates how to implement threshold logic where at least `M` out of `N` authorized signers must approve an action.

- Useful for DAOs, governance, and shared wallets.
- Shows how to use storage to track valid signers and thresholds.
- Demonstrates preventing duplicate approvals.

### 3. Sequential Authorization (Workflow)
The `sequential_auth_escrow` function shows a multi-step workflow.
- **Step 1:** Buyer authorizes funding.
- **Step 2:** Both Buyer and Seller must authorize release (2-of-2).
- Demonstrates how state can track the progress of multi-party actions across multiple transactions.

## Security Considerations

1. **Atomic Authorization:** `require_auth()` ensures that the specified address has signed the transaction for the current contract call.
2. **Order Independence:** The order in which `require_auth()` is called for different addresses does not matter; the host environment collects and verifies all required authorizations.
3. **Dynamic Lists:** When using `Vec<Address>` for signers, ensure the list is bounded to prevent excessive gas costs or potential "unbounded loop" attacks.
4. **Threshold Integrity:** Always verify that approvers are part of the recognized "valid signers" set to prevent unauthorized parties from contributing to a threshold.

## Gas Considerations
- Gas costs scale linearly with the number of authorizations.
- Each `require_auth()` call involves cryptographic verification of a signature (or contract authorization), which is a relatively expensive operation.


## Usage Tip

**Tip:** When integrating these patterns into your own contracts, always validate signer lists and thresholds at contract initialization to avoid accidental misconfiguration or security gaps. Consider providing admin functions to update signers or thresholds securely.

## Clarification

**Note:** The provided examples focus on demonstrating authorization logic and do not perform actual token transfers. In production, you should integrate with token contracts and handle errors and edge cases appropriately.

## How to run tests

```bash
cargo test -p multi-party-auth
```
